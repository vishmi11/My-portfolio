## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
cd YOUR_REPO

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Run the development server
npm start

# 4. Build for production
npm run build

# 5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the portfolio.

## Customization

You can customize the portfolio by editing the configuration file `config/portfolioData.json`. This allows you to update your personal info, skills, projects, and contact details.  

**Skill Icons Mapping:**  

If you want to add new skills, the icons are mapped in the frontend using a predefined set. To ensure new skills display correctly:

- Open `Skills.js` in `components/`
- Update the `skillIcons` object with the new skill name and corresponding React Icon component
- Example format: `"Skill Name": IconComponent`

This ensures new skills added in `portfolioData.json` display with the correct icon and progress bar.

**Backend & Environment Variables (Optional for Contact Form)**

The contact form requires a backend server to send emails. In this project, a **serverless function** is used for sending emails via **Nodemailer**.  

To enable the contact form on your deployment (e.g., Vercel), you need to add the following environment variables:

| Variable      | Description                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| `SMTP_HOST`   | SMTP server host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)  |
| `SMTP_PORT`   | SMTP server port (e.g., 465 for SSL)    |
| `EMAIL_USER`  | Your email address used to send emails   |
| `EMAIL_PASS`  | Your email account password or app token |

**Steps:**

1. Go to your deployment platform (like Vercel).
2. Navigate to your project’s **Settings → Environment Variables**.
3. Add each variable with the appropriate value.
4. Redeploy your project for changes to take effect.

> **Note:** These environment variables are only needed for the contact form functionality. The frontend will work without them, but emails won’t be sent.
